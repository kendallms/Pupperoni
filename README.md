**Pupperoni was a project dedicated to finding your perfect puppy match.**

Often times, people who want a specific dog breed _immediately_ go to a breeder before considering dogs in shelters. Pupperoni was developed as a solution to this. Users can start by viewing the breed of their choice, and then seeing similar breeds that may also be compatible. Once the user has a few breeds in mind, they can search for them in local shelters.

Using the Perfinder API and American Kennel Club API, Pupperoni allows the user to view all breeds of interest, and find those breeds available for adoption nearby a user&#39;s point of interest.
